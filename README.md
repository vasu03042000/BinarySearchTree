# BinarySearchTree
A binary search tree which includes insertion, deletion, inorder printing of the string.

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree in which all the nodes follow the below-mentioned properties −

The left sub-tree of a node has a key less than or equal to its parent node's key.

The right sub-tree of a node has a key greater than to its parent node's key.

Thus, BST divides all its sub-trees into two segments; the left sub-tree and the right sub-tree and can be defined as −

left_subtree (keys)  ≤  node (key)  ≤  right_subtree (keys)
Representation
BST is a collection of nodes arranged in a way where they maintain BST properties. Each node has a key and an associated value. While searching, the desired key is compared to the keys in BST and if found, the associated value is retrieved.

Following is a pictorial representation of BST −

Binary Search Tree
We observe that the root node key (27) has all less-valued keys on the left sub-tree and the higher valued keys on the right sub-tree.

Basic Operations
Following are the basic operations of a tree −

Search − Searches an element in a tree.

Insert − Inserts an element in a tree.

Pre-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in a pre-order manner.

In-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in an in-order manner.

Post-order Traversal − Traverses a tree in a post-order manner.
